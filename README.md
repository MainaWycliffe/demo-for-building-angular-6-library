# A Demo for Building Libraries for Angular

This is a demo on how to build **Angular 6 Libraries**. The library is under the **projects/test-library** directory.

To test this demo, first install the packages using your favorite package manager:

`yarn install or npm install`

Then build the test library first:

`ng build test-library`

And finally run the angular application:

`ng s --aot`
